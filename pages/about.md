Spaceways is a set of digital tools and products that hopes to answer the question of what livability "really" means. We intend to deliver rich insights that align the idea of livability to the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">UN Social Development Guidelines</a> for government, property, and commercial through our two different products, Atlas and Enquire.

## Enquire
Enquire is our unique approach to gathering data through questionaires. You can ask a cohort of users a set of questions that align to the goal that you're tracking, and then ask those same users again in six months.

## Atlas
Atlas allows anyone to take a deep dive into the data provided by Enquire, through the use of different views - you will be able to access anonymysed data by either persona, LGA/Postcode, or goal. You will also be able to gather cencus data.  

## Values
These are our values
- Ensuring that our data collection process is diverise, thorough, and comprehensive
- We put a big value on the accessibility of both our data and our product. 
- Security is a major priority for us and will always be our first and primary concern.
